As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A registration stack consisting of a Custom Resource AWS Lambda function that will invoke the TrueVoice PoV registration API and return a registration ID as a CloudFormation output.

After successful registration, an AWS Service Catalog Product will be made available to the account from where the Quick Start was launched, providing a template that sets up the following:

* An S3 bucket intended for integration with customer-dedicated resources in the TrueVoice AWS account and used as a staging area for audio files sourced from on‑premises telephony systems or Amazon Connect.
* A Lambda function tasked with transferring files from the customer’s integration bucket to the TrueVoice AWS account.
* The required Lambda AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Execution Role to carry out the transfer from the integration bucket to the customer-dedicated resources in the TrueVoice AWS account.
